## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **canonical Toastmasters International rules** for the Toast-Stats application.

Its goals are to:

- Establish authoritative rules for Distinguished Club Program (DCP) qualification
- Define membership and payment requirements
- Document Club Success Plan (CSP) requirements
- Specify Area and Division recognition criteria
- Provide a mapping between legacy assumptions and current official rules

This document is **normative** and supersedes any conflicting assumptions from legacy reports or PDFs.

Kiro MUST treat this document as the **primary source of truth** for all Toastmasters rule-related decisions.

## 2. Program Year Structure

### 2.1 Program Year Definition

- **Duration**: July 1 through June 30
- **Example**: Program Year 2025-2026 runs July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026
- **Recognition Period**: Distinguished status is evaluated at program year end

### 2.2 Program Year Calculation

```typescript
function getProgramYear(date: Date): string {
  const year = date.getFullYear()
  const month = date.getMonth() + 1 // 1-12

  if (month >= 7) {
    return `${year}-${year + 1}`
  } else {
    return `${year - 1}-${year}`
  }
}
```

## 3. Distinguished Club Program (DCP)

### 3.1 DCP Goals Overview

The DCP consists of **10 goals** that clubs work toward during the program year:

| Goal | Description                            | Requirement                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | Level 1 Awards                         | 4 or more                           |
| 2    | Level 2 Awards                         | 2 or more                           |
| 3    | Additional Level 2 Awards              | 2 additional (4 total)              |
| 4    | Level 3 Awards                         | 2 or more                           |
| 5    | Level 4/Path Completion/DTM Awards     | 1 or more                           |
| 6    | Additional Level 4/Path Completion/DTM | 1 additional (2 total)              |
| 7    | New Members                            | 4 or more                           |
| 8    | Additional New Members                 | 4 additional (8 total)              |
| 9    | Officer Training                       | 4+ officers trained in each round   |
| 10   | Administrative Excellence              | Officer list on time + dues on time |

### 3.2 Distinguished Club Levels

| Level                     | DCP Goals Required | Membership Requirement | Alternative       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Distinguished             | 5 goals            | 20 members             | OR net growth ≥ 3 |
| Select Distinguished      | 7 goals            | 20 members             | OR net growth ≥ 5 |
| President's Distinguished | 9 goals            | 20 members             | —                 |
| Smedley Distinguished     | 10 goals           | 25 members             | —                 |

### 3.3 CSP Requirement (2025-2026 and later)

**Starting in program year 2025-2026**, clubs MUST have a submitted Club Success Plan (CSP) to qualify for any Distinguished level.

- **CSP Submitted**: Club is eligible for Distinguished recognition
- **CSP Not Submitted**: Club cannot achieve Distinguished status regardless of goals/membership
- **Historical Data**: For program years prior to 2025-2026, CSP field did not exist; assume submitted

### 3.4 Recognition Timing

- Distinguished status is **only valid from April 1 onwards** in the program year
- Before April 1, clubs may meet requirements but are not officially recognized
- Final recognition is determined at program year end (June 30)

---

## 4. Membership Requirements

### 4.1 Membership Dues Payment Schedule

Members pay dues **twice per year**, aligned with the two renewal periods:

- **October Renewal** (Oct–Mar period): Dues for the first half of the program year
- **April Renewal** (Apr–Sep period): Dues for the second half of the program year

This means a club's `paymentsCount` (total dues payments) can be **up to 2× its membership count**, depending on when members joined and which renewal periods have passed. For example, a club with 10 members that has been through both renewal periods could have up to 20 payments.

The `paymentBase` at the district level represents the baseline payment count at the start of the program year. Payment growth (`totalPayments - paymentBase`) reflects both new member joins and renewal completions.

### 4.2 Paid Club Definition

A club is considered "paid" (in good standing) when:

- Club status is "Active"
- Membership dues are current

A club is NOT considered paid when status is:

- "Suspended"
- "Ineligible"
- "Low"

### 4.3 Membership Thresholds

| Threshold              | Count                         | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Minimum for Charter    | 20 members                    | New club formation                  |
| Distinguished Minimum  | 20 members                    | Base distinguished qualification    |
| Smedley Minimum        | 25 members                    | Smedley distinguished qualification |
| Low Membership Warning | < 12 members                  | Club health concern                 |
| Intervention Required  | < 12 members + net growth < 3 | Critical club health                |

### 4.4 Net Growth Calculation

```typescript
netGrowth = currentActiveMembers - membershipBase
```

- **Membership Base**: Starting membership count at beginning of program year
- **Net Growth Alternative**: Allows clubs with fewer than 20 members to qualify for Distinguished/Select if they achieve sufficient growth

---

## 5. Club Health Classification

### 5.1 Classification Rules

Clubs are classified into exactly one of three categories:

| Status                    | Criteria                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intervention Required** | Membership < 12 AND net growth < 3                                  |
| **Thriving**              | Membership requirement met AND DCP checkpoint met AND CSP submitted |
| **Vulnerable**            | Any requirement not met (but not intervention required)             |

### 5.2 Membership Requirement for Thriving

A club meets the membership requirement if:

- Membership ≥ 20, OR
- Net growth ≥ 3

### 5.3 DCP Checkpoint by Month

| Month     | Minimum DCP Goals  |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| July      | 0 (administrative) |
| August    | 0                  |
| September | 1                  |
| October   | 1                  |
| November  | 2                  |
| December  | 2                  |
| January   | 3                  |
| February  | 4                  |
| March     | 4                  |
| April     | 5                  |
| May       | 5                  |
| June      | 5                  |

## 11. Calculation Precedence

When calculating recognition status, apply rules in this order:

1. **Eligibility Gates**: Check club visits (if data available)
2. **Paid Status**: Determine paid clubs/areas
3. **Paid Threshold**: Verify minimum paid percentage met
4. **Distinguished Calculation**: Calculate distinguished % against paid units only
5. **Recognition Level**: Assign highest level for which all criteria are met

---

## 12. Implementation Requirements

1. **CSP Check**: Always check CSP status for 2025-2026+ data
2. **Paid Denominator**: Distinguished percentages MUST use paid units as denominator
3. **Eligibility First**: Evaluate eligibility gates before scoring metrics
4. **Highest Level**: Recognition level is the highest level for which ALL criteria are met
5. **Unknown Handling**: When eligibility cannot be determined, mark as "Unknown"
6. **April 1 Cutoff**: Distinguished recognition only valid from April 1 onwards

## 13. Version History

> **Distinguished percentages use paid units as denominator.**  
> **Eligibility gates are hard blockers.**  
> **Recognition levels are ordinal and mutually exclusive.**  
> **When in doubt, defer to current Toastmasters International official rules.**
