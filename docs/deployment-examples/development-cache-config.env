# Development Notes:
# - CACHE_DIR=./cache creates a cache directory in your project root
# - This makes it easy to inspect cached data during development
# - The cache directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
# - You can delete the cache directory to start fresh: rm -rf ./cache
# - For testing different cache locations, change CACHE_DIR to an absolute path
