 * Distinguished Club Analytics Module
 *
 * Handles DCP goals analysis, distinguished club projections, and achievement tracking.
 * This is the hardened version moved from backend/src/services/analytics/DistinguishedClubAnalyticsModule.ts
 * and adapted to work with DistrictStatistics[] instead of IAnalyticsDataSource.
 *
 * KEY FEATURES (preserved from backend):
 * 1. generateDistinguishedClubAnalytics() returning full DistinguishedClubAnalytics type
 * 2. calculateDistinguishedClubs() for counting clubs at each level
 * 3. calculateDistinguishedProjection() for trend-based projections (DEPRECATED - see below)
 * 4. trackDistinguishedAchievements() for tracking when clubs achieve levels
 * 5. calculateDistinguishedYearOverYear() for year-over-year comparison
 * 6. analyzeDCPGoals() for identifying most/least commonly achieved goals
 *
 * NOTE: The linear regression projection in calculateDistinguishedProjection() is deprecated.
 * Projections now use thriving club count directly via generateDistinguishedProjection(thrivingCount).
 * See: projected-year-end-simplification spec, Requirement 1.3
 *
 * Requirements: 5.1, 5.2
