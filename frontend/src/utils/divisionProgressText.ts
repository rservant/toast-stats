/**
 * Division Progress Text Generation Module
 *
 * This module provides functions for generating concise English paragraphs
 * describing a division's progress toward Distinguished Division recognition.
 *
 * The generated text includes:
 * - Current recognition level achieved (or that it's not yet distinguished)
 * - Current metrics (paid clubs, distinguished clubs)
 * - What's needed to reach the next achievable level
 * - Incremental differences for higher levels (building on previous requirements)
 *
 * Key differences from Area Progress Text:
 * - DDP uses 45%/50%/55% thresholds vs DAP's 50%/50%+1/50%+1
 * - DDP requires base/base+1/base+2 paid clubs vs DAP's base/base/base+1
 * - DDP has NO club visit requirements (DAP requires 75% visits)
 *
 * Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7
