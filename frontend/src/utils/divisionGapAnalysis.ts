/**
 * Division Gap Analysis Calculation Module
 *
 * This module provides functions for calculating gap analysis for divisions
 * in the Distinguished Division Program (DDP). It determines what a division
 * needs to achieve each recognition level.
 *
 * DDP Criteria (from TOASTMASTERS_DASHBOARD_KNOWLEDGE.md):
 * - Eligibility: No net club loss (paidClubs >= clubBase)
 * - Distinguished Division: paidClubs >= clubBase AND distinguishedClubs >= 45% of clubBase
 * - Select Distinguished Division: paidClubs >= clubBase + 1 AND distinguishedClubs >= 50% of clubBase
 * - President's Distinguished Division: paidClubs >= clubBase + 2 AND distinguishedClubs >= 55% of clubBase
 *
 * Key differences from DAP (Distinguished Area Program):
 * - DDP uses 45%/50%/55% thresholds vs DAP's 50%/50%+1/50%+1
 * - DDP requires base/base+1/base+2 paid clubs vs DAP's base/base/base+1
 * - DDP has NO club visit requirements (DAP requires 75% visits)
 * - Distinguished percentage is calculated against club base (same as DAP)
 *
 * Requirements: 5.2, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
