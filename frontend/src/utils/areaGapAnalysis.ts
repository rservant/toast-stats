/**
 * Area Gap Analysis Calculation Module
 *
 * This module provides functions for calculating gap analysis for areas
 * in the Distinguished Area Program (DAP). It determines what an area
 * needs to achieve each recognition level.
 *
 * DAP Criteria (from TOASTMASTERS_DASHBOARD_KNOWLEDGE.md):
 * - Eligibility: No net club loss (paidClubs >= clubBase)
 * - Distinguished Area: paidClubs >= clubBase AND distinguishedClubs >= 50% of clubBase
 * - Select Distinguished Area: paidClubs >= clubBase AND distinguishedClubs >= 50% of clubBase + 1
 * - President's Distinguished Area: paidClubs >= clubBase + 1 AND distinguishedClubs >= 50% of clubBase + 1
 *
 * Key differences from previous implementation:
 * - Distinguished percentage is calculated against club base, not paid clubs
 * - Paid clubs threshold is >= club base (no net loss), not 75%
 * - Select Distinguished requires 50% + 1 additional club
 * - President's Distinguished requires club base + 1 paid clubs AND 50% + 1 distinguished
 *
 * Requirements: 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
