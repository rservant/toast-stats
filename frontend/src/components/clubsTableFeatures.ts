/**
 * The TanStack Table **v9 feature set** for the club table (#1530).
 *
 * v8 bundled every feature into `useReactTable`; v9 is modular — a feature's
 * state slice and its APIs only exist if that feature is registered here. A
 * missing feature is not a type error at the call site, it is a table that
 * silently ignores the state you hand it, so this file is the single place
 * that declares what the club table actually uses:
 *
 *   - `rowSortingFeature` + `sortedRowModel` — the controlled `sorting` slice
 *     and `getSortedRowModel()` row order (v8's `getSortedRowModel()` option).
 *   - `columnPinningFeature` — the controlled `columnPinning` slice that makes
 *     the sticky key column the model of record (ADR-006 §3).
 *   - `columnVisibilityFeature` — the controlled `columnVisibility` slice the
 *     column-groups menu drives (#819, ADR-006 §4).
 *
 * The core row model is automatic in v9; `getCoreRowModel()` is gone.
 *
 * `sortFns` registers only `basic` (v8's `sortingFn: 'basic'`, now `sortFn`).
 * Registering the whole built-in `sortFns` object would pull every comparator
 * into the bundle; every club column sorts with `basic` over a pre-normalised
 * accessor value, so one entry is the whole requirement. v9's `sortFn_basic`
 * (`a === b ? 0 : a > b ? 1 : -1`) is the same total order v8's `basic`
 * produced, and `sortUndefined` still defaults to 1 (undefined last).
 *
 * `tableMeta` is v9's per-table meta slot. It replaces the global
 * `declare module '@tanstack/react-table' { interface TableMeta ... }`
 * augmentation the v8 code used — which typed `meta` for EVERY table in the
 * app, not just this one.

 * Always build column arrays with `clubsColumnHelper.columns([...])` rather
 * than a bare array literal. v9 pins `TValue` per column, and a plain
 * heterogeneous array (string / number / display columns side by side) widens
