 *
 * This component validates Requirements 1.1, 8.1, 8.7:
 * - 1.1: Display one performance card for each division in the district
 * - 8.1: Use TM Loyal Blue (#004165) for primary elements including headers

 *
 * The component uses the Card component from the design system to ensure
 * consistent styling and brand compliance across the application.
