## Tooling

| Tool          | Command                      | Notes                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test runner   | `npm run test`               | Vitest — all workspaces                                 |
| Watch mode    | `npm run test:watch`         |                                                         |
| Coverage      | `npm run test -- --coverage` |                                                         |
| Formatting    | `npm run format`             | Prettier — no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indent |
| Linting       | `npm run lint`               | ESLint + YAML lint                                      |
| Type checking | `npm run typecheck`          | TypeScript strict mode                                  |

## Coverage Policy

All workspaces enforce minimum coverage thresholds via Vitest:

| Metric   | Minimum |
| -------- | ------- |
| Lines    | 50%     |
| Branches | 40%     |

Coverage is checked on every `git push` and in CI. PRs that reduce coverage below the floor are rejected.
