## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 02: Ephemeral Runners Need Explicit Cross-Date Data Syncs

**The Discovery**: The YoY comparison showed "No Historical Data" even though 9 years of snapshots existed in GCS. The `AnalyticsComputeService.computeDistrictAnalytics()` calls `loadDistrictSnapshot(previousYearDate)` from the local filesystem, but the ephemeral GitHub Actions runner only has today's scraped data. Previous year snapshots were never synced down.

**The Resulting Rule**: Any analytics computation that references data from a **different date** than the current run must have an explicit sync step in the pipeline. The time-series sync (Step 3) was already doing this correctly; the previous-year snapshot sync was simply missing.

**Future Warning**: When adding new cross-date analytics (e.g., multi-year trends, seasonal patterns), always verify the pipeline downloads the required historical data before compute. Check `AnalyticsComputeService` for any `loadDistrictSnapshot()` calls with non-current dates.

## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 01: Validation Gaps in Façade Layers

**The Discovery**: `SnapshotStore.hasDistrictInSnapshot` used `path.join` with raw `districtId` input, creating a path traversal vulnerability (CodeQL #57). The downstream modules (`SnapshotReader`, `SnapshotWriter`) already validated `districtId`, but the façade method bypassed them with inline `path.join`.

**The Scientific Proof**: A test with 7 malicious `districtId` values (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) was not rejected — all resolved to `false` instead of throwing, proving the vulnerability existed.

**The Farley Principle Applied**: Defense in Depth. Validation must happen at every layer that constructs paths, not just internal modules.

**The Resulting Rule**: When a façade delegates to sub-modules, any method that constructs paths directly (rather than delegating) must also call the shared validation utilities (`validateDistrictId`, `resolvePathUnderBase`).

## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 03: Date-Aware Charts Beat Index-Based Positioning

**The Discovery**: The Membership Trend chart positioned data points using array index (`index / (length - 1) * width`), making the x-axis span only the data range. With sparse data (e.g., 2 points), the chart showed "Feb 21 – Feb 21" with no program year context.

**The Fix**: Use `calculateProgramYearDay()` to map dates to their position within the July 1 – June 30 program year. This ensures the x-axis always represents the full 365-day program year, and data points cluster where they actually occurred in time.

**The Resulting Rule**: Time-series visualizations should always use date-based positioning, not array-index-based. Pair with reference lines for domain-significant dates to give users context about what happened when.

**Future Warning**: If a new method is added to `SnapshotStore` that accepts `districtId` or `snapshotId` and constructs paths inline, it must validate inputs. Audit all `path.join` calls using user-supplied values.

## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 04: Summary vs Full Analytics Have Different Data Granularity

**The Discovery**: The membership badge on the Overview tab showed +61 instead of -66. Root cause: `DistrictOverview` called `/analytics` (which returns a **sparse 2-point** `membershipTrend` spanning Feb 2025 → Feb 2026), while the correct value came from `/analytics-summary` (134-point `trends.membership` scoped to Jul 2025 → Feb 2026). The two endpoints return the same field name but with vastly different data ranges and granularity.

**The Resulting Rule**: When a component needs derived values, always verify which API endpoint provides the data and whether the data range matches the intended scope (program year vs. calendar year). Never assume two endpoints with similar field names return equivalent data.

**Future Warning**: Any new component that derives statistics from trend data must confirm it's using the aggregated summary (program-year scoped) rather than the full analytics endpoint (which may span multiple years with sparse points).
