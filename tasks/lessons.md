## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 02: Ephemeral Runners Need Explicit Cross-Date Data Syncs

**The Discovery**: The YoY comparison showed "No Historical Data" even though 9 years of snapshots existed in GCS. The `AnalyticsComputeService.computeDistrictAnalytics()` calls `loadDistrictSnapshot(previousYearDate)` from the local filesystem, but the ephemeral GitHub Actions runner only has today's scraped data. Previous year snapshots were never synced down.

**The Resulting Rule**: Any analytics computation that references data from a **different date** than the current run must have an explicit sync step in the pipeline. The time-series sync (Step 3) was already doing this correctly; the previous-year snapshot sync was simply missing.

**Future Warning**: When adding new cross-date analytics (e.g., multi-year trends, seasonal patterns), always verify the pipeline downloads the required historical data before compute. Check `AnalyticsComputeService` for any `loadDistrictSnapshot()` calls with non-current dates.

## 🗓️ 2026-02-22 — Lesson 01: Validation Gaps in Façade Layers

**The Discovery**: `SnapshotStore.hasDistrictInSnapshot` used `path.join` with raw `districtId` input, creating a path traversal vulnerability (CodeQL #57). The downstream modules (`SnapshotReader`, `SnapshotWriter`) already validated `districtId`, but the façade method bypassed them with inline `path.join`.

**The Scientific Proof**: A test with 7 malicious `districtId` values (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`) was not rejected — all resolved to `false` instead of throwing, proving the vulnerability existed.

**The Farley Principle Applied**: Defense in Depth. Validation must happen at every layer that constructs paths, not just internal modules.

**The Resulting Rule**: When a façade delegates to sub-modules, any method that constructs paths directly (rather than delegating) must also call the shared validation utilities (`validateDistrictId`, `resolvePathUnderBase`).

**Future Warning**: If a new method is added to `SnapshotStore` that accepts `districtId` or `snapshotId` and constructs paths inline, it must validate inputs. Audit all `path.join` calls using user-supplied values.
